				Beggining with an Android Phone

        So you have just picked up your first Android phone This guide will help you understand and adapt to life with an Android.
				<br><br>
				Note that some parts of your phone will probably look different from the screenshots we took here, which were taken on a Nexus 4 running Google's default stock Android environment. Devices like the Samsung Galaxy S series have a variety of interface changes made by the phone's manufacturer.
				<br><br><br>

				<span id="article_point">Google Account Setup</span>
        The first time you turn on an Android device, you will be asked to enter your Google account details - or create a Google account if you dont already have one. This is technically optional, as you can use an Android phone without even having a Google account, but it is a good idea.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        Android is Google's operating system, and a Google account is tightly linked with the OS. Your Google account is used to back up your phone's settings, keep track of installed apps, and link included apps with Google services like Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts. If you ever get a new Android phone or restore your current phone to its factory default settings, a Google account ensures that it's all backed up. You can also access email, contacts, calendar events, and other data on the web. Android can even automatically upload your photos to a private album on Google+ so you'll always have a backup copy.
        <br><br>
        If you opt not to enter Google account credentials while setting up your Android phone, you can add an account later from Android's settings screen.
				<br><br><br>

				<span id="article_point">Using Your Phone as a Phone</span>
				Like other smartphones, Android phones have more in common with computers than they do with traditional phones. They can be used for web browsing, email, and anything else there's an app for - from streaming videos and playing games to editing photos and writing office documents.

				<span id="article_point">Getting Around the OS</span>
				When you turn on your Android device, you'll see the lock screen, where you can configure a code, pattern, or password so no one can use your phone without your permission.
				<br><br>

        <br>
				Unlock your phone and you'll see your home screen. The home screen is a place where you can place icons for your favorite apps and add widgets. For example, if you're a frequent Gmail user, you can add a Gmail widget so you can see your inbox on your home screen without opening any apps. If you frequently use other apps, you can place icons for them on your home screen.
				<br><br>
				Tap the circle-with-dots button at the bottom of your home screen to open the app drawer. The app drawer lists all the apps you have installed on your Android phone. Unlike on Apple's iPhone, where the home screen is always just a list of the apps you have installed, the home screen and list of installed apps are separate on Android.
        <br><br>

        <br>
				From the app drawer, you can swipe around to view your installed apps and launch one by tapping it. To place an app on your home screen, long-press it and drag it wherever you like. To learn more about customizing your home screen, read our guide to customizing your Android home screen.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        Press the buttons on the bottom of your screen to control your phone. There's a home button that will instantly take you back to your home screen and a back button that will take you back anywhere in Android - it may go to the app you previously used or a previous screen in the app you're currently in. Depending on your phone, you may have a multitasking button for switching between open windows or a menu button that opens an app's menus.
        <br><br>
        When you're done with an app, just tap the home button to return to your home screen, use the back button to leave the app, or use the app switcher to switch to another app. Android automatically manages running apps, so you don't have to worry about closing them.
				<br><br>
        To switch between open apps, tap the multitasking button. If you don’t have a multitasking button, you may have to double-tap or long-press the home button to bring up the app switcher on your phone. This will vary from phone to phone.
