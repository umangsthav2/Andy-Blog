				5 things everyone should do with their Android phone
			</div>	
		
			<div id="article">
				If you've got an Android phone, be it a Nexus 5 or a Galaxy Note 3, there are all kinds of cool things you can do with it: from custom ROMs, alternative launchers, apps of all shapes and sizes, LED notifications, gesture controls, icon packs and tweaks, hacks and secrets from here until the cows home. But there are only five things that every single Android owner simply must do.Here they are:
				<br><br>

				<br>
				<span id="article_point">1. Set up Android Device Manager</span>
				How Android Device Manager is not pre-enabled on every single Android phone I simply don't know. Android Device Manager is a great tool that lets you track a lost or stolen phone, remotely lock it, ring it, or delete its contents and even display a lock screen message for anyone that finds it. It may not be the sexiest thing you do with your Android phone, but it should be the first thing you do.
				<br><br>
				<center><img src="images/ph1.jpg"></center>
				<br>
				You'll find the permissions for Android Device Manager in the Google Setting app under Security. You can enable Android Device Manager to remotely locate your phone as well as lock or erase its contents. But you'll also need to activate Android Device Manager as a device administrator. Go to Settings > Security > Device Administrators and check the box next to Android Device Manager.
				You'll need to root your device to really take full advantage, which is simple enough but will take a little time to manage if you're new to the process. If you do decide to root then you may also consider Titanium Backup Pro for freezing unwanted apps.

				<br>
				<span id="article_point">2. Supercharge your Wi-Fi</span>
				Did you know in Google Chrome's settings you can tell your favorite browser to save you time and money by reducing your data usage? No? Most people don't. By using this setting, I've cut my data usage by 30 percent in the last month. How's that for easy savings? Go to Chrome > Settings > Reduce Data Usage and turn it on.

				<br>
				Likewise, did you know you can tell your phone to avoid poor Wi-Fi connections and Just go to Settings > Wi-Fi > Advanced Wi-Fi Optimization and turn it on to save battery while Wi-Fi is on. While you're at it, be sure to check the box to avoid poor Wi-Fi connections so you're not sucking precious battery power trying to connect to crappy Wi-Fi.

				Always keeping your Wi-Fi on while asleep also saves battery life by not having to constantly reconnect every time you wake your phone up.
				<br><br><br>
				<span id="article_point">3. Pushbullet all the things</span>
				There aren't too many apps that I think absolutely everyone should use, because everyone has different tastes, needs and habits. But Pushbullet is different. Everyone, and I mean everyone, should be using it.
				<br><br>

				<br>
				You can push links on your phone to your tablet, links from your PC to your phone or links from your phone to all of your devices. Copying and pasting URLs is like, so 1999. Pushbullet also notifies you of SMS or calls on your PC and you can transfer files between all of your devices with Pushbullet too.
				<br><br><br>

				<span id="article_point">4. Save time with NFC</span>
				Unless you're already an NFC fan, most people don't even realize what NFC is, how it works or what it can do for you. But NFC is brilliant. A single tap can pair your Bluetooth headphones to your phone, transfer all of the contents of your old phone to a new one, or even send a default message to a contact when you walk in the door at home.
				<br><br>
				Heck, some guy even implanted an NFC chip in his hand so he'd never have to unlock his phone again. You don't have to go that far, but some NFC-equipped devices and a pack of NFC tags will change your life and save you precious time. NFC is one of the coolest and underrated things to do with your Android
				<br><br><br>

				<span id="article_point">5. Setup lock screen security</span>
				If your adventurous nature stops a little short of implanting an NFC chip in your person, the next best thing to do is setup your lock screen security. I am forever surprised by just how many of my friends don't have lock screen security set up.

				<br>
				If you lose your phone or have it stolen do you really want that thief to have access to all the intimate corners of your smartphone? No? Then set up a pattern or PIN lock right now. Just go to Settings > Security > Screen lock or on some devices Settings > Lock Screen to set up your preferred type of lock screen security.
