				How to make the Samsung Galaxy S4 run faster

				The Samsung Galaxy S4 has been around for a while now, but it's still a great phone. However if you put it up against its successor or the latest flagships from other firms it may seem a little sluggish. That's partly because its internals aren't as quick, but it's mainly because a few little things could be slowing it down. Here's how to make your Samsung Galaxy S4 faster for better performance.
        <br><br><br>
				<span id="article_point">Update Android</span>
				The KitKat update caused performance problems for some users, but Lollipop is much better and delivers significant performance benefits as well as a much nicer interface and a different way of running apps. The rollout of Lollipop for the Samsung Galaxy S4 has started, but as is often the case it's taking its time in some territories. There's a way around that if you're in an affected area, though: the international firmware is online and it's possible to download that and install it yourself.

				While upgrading Android to Lollipop should make things more speedy there are still issues that might slow down your Samsung, so for example you might still want to disable animations or use a custom launcher.
        <br><br><br>
				<span id="article_point">Turn off bits of TouchWiz</span>
				Samsung's own TouchWiz interface has its fans, but on the Samsung Galaxy S4 it can also slow things down a bit with some unnecessary effects (and other launchers may do the same, so have a look in their settings and disable anything you don't need). In TouchWiz you can turn them off by putting your S4 into developer mode, which gives you access to settings you wouldn't normally see. To do that:
        <br><br>  
        Go to Settings > More >Developer Options
        <br><br>
        If that isn't there, go into About Device, scroll to Build Number and tap that five times. You should now see a message that tells you "Developer mode" has been enabled. Repeat the previous step.

				<br>
				Look for Window Animation Scale, Transition Animation Scale and Animator Duration Scale.
        You have two options with each of these: you can turn them off altogether, or you can double their speed by setting the scale to 0.5x (the other options are greater than 1 so they all slow things down even more). The difference is surprising, and makes your phone feel much faster.
        <br><br>
        TouchWiz isn't the only potential culprit when it comes to performance issues, though. Here are a few other things to check out.
				<br><br><br>
        
        <span id="article_point">Disable the lock effect</span>
        Lock screen animations are cute, but they also add unnecessary delay to something you do countless times a day. To disable them, go into My Device &gt; Lock Screen and tap on Lock Effect. Choose "None" to disable the animations.

				<br><br><br>
        <span id="article_point">Tell S Voice to get stuffed</span>
        S Voice is Samsung's voice control app, and if you don't use it it's slowing down your phone. That's because whenever you press the home button, your device is waiting to see if you're going to press it again to start S Voice. To turn that off, double-press the Home button and then go into Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Open via the home key. Uncheck the box to remove the S Voice delay.
