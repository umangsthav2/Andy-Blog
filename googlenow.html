			<br>
			To get started, you'll first need to launch Google Now from either your lock screen by swiping up towards the 'Google' icon or by swiping up from any of your soft keys. You can press in and swipe up from the back arrow, home key, and recents key.
			<br><br>

			<br><br>
			If you haven't launched Google Now until now &nbsp;you'll need to tap through the welcome screen setup.
			<br><br>

			<br>
			Now go ahead and scroll down the to very bottom and tap the 3 dots (menu button) in the bottom right corner. This will launch the Google Now / Voice Search settings. Tap Google Now to customize your Google Now cards.
			<br><br>

			<br>
			You can also view Sample Cards and configure them from the Google Now home screen. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and tap "Show sample card".
			<br><br>

			<br>
			Most of you will probably need to leave these settings set to default until you get a better feel for Google Now and what information you wish to have at your fingertips, without having to dig through your phone.  Now that you have your cards setup, you need to populate them with some data. You can do that by using Voice Search. You can tap the microphone icon and search for your favorite sports team, weather, restaurant, flight numbers, or anything related to the sample cards provided for you.
			<br><br>

			<br>
			For example: "What's the weather today?"Do the Yankee's play today?" I'm hungry for Chinese food. You get the idea.
			<br><br>

			<br>
			Now you privacy folks you'll need to remove your tin foil hats for the next part. As I said earlier, to fully get the most of of Google Now, you'll need to setup a few more tasks revolving around your location.
			<br><br>
			Next, tap Manage location settings. This will take you into Maps settings. For best results, you'll want location history enabled.
			<br><br>
			Next, so that Google Now can identify your home and work address correctly (instead of your favorite place to hangout) launch Maps. Now select Location history. From here you'll have the option to configure your home and work locations.
			<br><br>
			<center><img src="images/googlenow7.jpg"></center>
			<br>
			Now you have Google Now setup and ready to show you some cards. You should start seeing cards immediately for weather, distance to work / home, and possibly other locations. If you're near a bus station you may see that data populate right away as well. As mentioned earlier, you'll want to start using Voice Search and searching for other card related items to let Google Now know you're interested. After you start putting information into Google Now, you'll start to see cards show up in your notifications. Just tap on them to view them or at anytime you can swipe up from your soft keys or home screen.
